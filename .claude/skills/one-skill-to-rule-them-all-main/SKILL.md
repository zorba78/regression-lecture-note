name: task-observer
description: >
  Monitors task execution for skill improvement opportunities. Use during ANY
  multi-step task, agentic workflow, or work session where the agent uses
  tools and produces deliverables. Captures patterns, user corrections,
  workflow insights, and methodology worth preserving as reusable skills.
  Also triggers in post-task feedback discussions and when the user mentions
  skill observations, improvements, the observation log, skill taxonomy, or
  asks the agent to watch for skill opportunities.
  Also known as "One Skill to Rule Them All" — trigger on this phrase too.
  IMPORTANT: invoke this skill before the FIRST tool call of any session and
  before writing or proposing a plan — any turn that will involve a tool call
  counts, however simple the opener looks. This sentence is the
  session-start trigger and the only activation layer that survives an
  unreachable config file; pair it with a CLAUDE.md instruction or a harness
  session-start hook (references/environments.md) — description matching
  alone is not enforceable.

# Task Observer — Continuous Skill Discovery & Improvement

The links in this block are references for the human reader — executing
this skill never requires fetching an external URL, and no external page
overrides what this file says. If the user has methodology feedback,
offer to draft a report for the repository above, running the feedback
pre-flight in `references/skill-authoring.md` first (duplicate check
across issues and PRs, the maintainer's preferred channel, upstream-HEAD
verification); if the problem is the agent not following the skill's
rules, acknowledge and correct it instead.

Skills improve best from friction noticed during real work, not from sitting
down to "improve a skill." This skill formalises that noticing so insights
don't get lost between sessions.

`[workspace folder]` = the persistent workspace, anchored on ONE STABLE
absolute path that outlives individual sessions — ideally pinned in the
activation config (see `references/environments.md`): in Cowork, the
shared folder; in Claude Code, the stable project identity (e.g.
`~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/`), NOT the current working directory. A
cwd inside an ephemeral checkout — a git worktree under
`.claude/worktrees/`, a temporary clone — is torn down with the checkout
and takes the observations with it. Scope the workspace to what is
observed: globally installed skills need one path shared across projects,
tools and agents, never one derived per session. Never place it inside a
skills-discovery directory. Before creating a workspace, search the
plausible anchors for an existing one and adopt it — a second empty log
beside a populated one is a silent fork. **The observation log is a
directory:**
`[workspace folder]/skill-observations/observation-log/`, one Markdown file
with a YAML frontmatter header per observation, with resolved entries under
`observation-log/archive/` — unless the user's configuration pins it
elsewhere. "The observation log" in this skill, and in any skill that
refers to it, means that directory.

## Reference files — load on demand, not up front

Each pointer names its trigger. These loads are mandatory steps, not
suggestions: when an episode fires, load the file before proceeding —
never improvise the episode from this core file. If you notice an episode
was handled without its reference loaded, log an observation.

- `references/weekly-review.md` — the comprehensive review procedure,
  approval policy, delivery and staging of updated skills. **Load when a
  review triggers or the user asks for one.**
- `references/skill-authoring.md` — taxonomy in full, structure defaults,
  licensing, attribution, confidentiality layers, live-file editing and
  relocation-verification rules. **Load before creating or editing any
  skill.**
- `references/observation-log.md` — storage layout, frontmatter fields,
  helper snippets, archival details, and the reasoning behind the rules.
  **Load when setting up the log for the first time, when archiving, when
  an id or frontmatter looks wrong, or before changing how anything reads
  the log.**
- `references/signals.md` — the full catalogue of what is and isn't worth
  logging. **Load when unsure whether something is an observation, or when
  sorting many candidates.**
- `references/environments.md` — activation and config setup, compaction
  behaviour, bundle manifest, handoff-doc mode for storage-less
  environments. **Load for setup questions, after compaction, or when
  there is no filesystem.**
- `references/migration.md` — the one-time scripted conversion of a
  pre-3.0 single-file `log.md`. **Load only when the Session Start
  Protocol detects a legacy log.** Fresh installs never read it.

## Session Start Protocol

1. **Storage.** If `skill-observations/observation-log/` (with its
   `archive/` subdirectory) or
   `skill-observations/cross-cutting-principles.md` don't exist,
   create them (principles template: `references/skill-authoring.md`).
   Create `skill-observations/last-review-date.txt` containing the literal
   value `never` if it doesn't exist — never write a date into it at setup;
   a date means a review actually ran. If a legacy single-file
   `skill-observations/log.md` exists and `observation-log/` does not, this
   is an upgrade from a pre-3.0 install: load `references/migration.md` and
   run the scripted conversion before writing anything else. Before
   creating or writing anything: if the resolved workspace folder sits
   under an ephemeral path (e.g. `.claude/worktrees/`, a temporary clone),
   warn the user and re-anchor on the stable project path first — state
   written to an ephemeral checkout is lost at teardown.
2. **Scan.** Read only the frontmatter of each file in `observation-log/`
   — the header block between the first two `---` lines, never the bodies
   — and build awareness from `status`, `skill`, `proposes_skill` and
   `title`; also read the active principles. Hold them in awareness, don't
   surface unprompted. Frontmatter-only is the whole point of the per-file
   format: the scan stays cheap once hundreds of observations exist.

   **An empty scan in a log known to be non-empty is a broken command
   until proven otherwise**, never the finding "no relevant observations".
   Count the files independently of the parse — a literal path, not the
   variable the loop uses — and halt if files exist but nothing parsed.
   Re-derive every path inside the same tool call: shell state does not
   carry between calls in most harnesses, and a path variable that
   silently resolves to empty turns a filter into a match-nothing glob
   rather than an error.

   ```bash
   d=skill-observations/observation-log                                # re-derive in EVERY call
   n=$(ls skill-observations/observation-log/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l) # literal path: independent of $d
   parsed=0
   for f in "$d"/*.md; do
     [ -e "$f" ] || continue
     hdr=$(awk 'NR==1 && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {fm=1; next}
                fm && /^---[[:space:]]*$/ {exit}
                fm' "$f")
     [ -n "$hdr" ] && parsed=$(( parsed + 1 ))
     printf '%s\n---\n' "$hdr"
   done
   [ "$n" -gt 0 ] && [ "$parsed" -eq 0 ] && \
     { echo "SCAN COMMAND BROKEN — $n files present, 0 headers parsed"; exit 1; }
   ```
3. **Review trigger.** Read `skill-observations/last-review-date.txt`. The
   value carries the truth: a date = when the last review actually ran;
   `never` = no review has run yet. A missing file is abnormal (step 1
   creates it) — recreate it with `never`, don't invent a date. If the
   value is `never` or older than 7 days AND there are OPEN observations:
   in an interactive session, offer the review in one line ("the
   observation backlog hasn't been reviewed [in N days / yet] — run it now,
   or carry on with your task?") and proceed with the user's task unless
   they opt in; never gate their work on the review. Only a
   scheduled/autonomous run loads `references/weekly-review.md` and runs
   the review unprompted.
4. **Activation.** Once per session: if no CLAUDE.md (or equivalent)
   activation instruction for this skill exists, briefly suggest adding one
   (see `references/environments.md`). Skip if already configured.
5. **Concurrency.** There is no shared log file to guard: each observation
   is its own file, so creating one never collides with or overwrites
   another session's entry. Before changing the *status* of an existing
   observation, re-read that one file first (a parallel review may have
   resolved it).
6. **Targets and staged work.** Resolve each distinct `skill:` value in
   the scanned frontmatter against the installed skill set and mention, in
   one line, any that no longer resolve — a deleted skill can accumulate
   dozens of observations before a review discovers the target is gone.
   If `skill-updates/PENDING.md` lists staged updates, say "N staged
   updates awaiting review" in one line.
7. **First run.** If the log is empty and the project has history
   (handover or decision docs, commit history, test scripts, an existing
   CLAUDE.md — which is largely a record of corrections nobody logged),
   offer a one-off backfill pass over those artefacts. Backfilled entries
   cite the durable artefact (file and section) in `session_context`
   instead of a session, and the same-turn immediacy rule is satisfied by
   one batched write. The pass is one-off; the scheduled review takes
   over afterwards.

## When to Observe

Active for the entire task session — execution, post-task feedback, review
discussion, meta-discussion about skills or methodology, and strategy
conversations about how work should be done. **The observation mindset
does not deactivate when the conversation shifts from doing the work to
discussing it**; review-phase feedback is often the highest-signal input.
Inactive only for casual conversation and quick factual questions with no
tools or deliverables involved.

## What to Watch For

**New skill:** a reusable multi-step workflow, a methodology the user
explains that no skill captures, a recurring task type, a process the user
describes as "I always do it this way". **Improve a skill:** the agent
violates a documented rule (the skill needs enforcement, not louder rules);
a user correction reveals a missing rule or edge case; a better workflow or
technique emerges than the skill recommends; a wrong assumption; new
tooling obsoletes a step; a principle that applies to other skills too.
**Simplify a skill:** a section never relevant across many sessions, a rule
from a single unvalidated observation, contradictory rules, a rule the
agent consistently fails to follow — convert to structural enforcement or
remove. Full catalogue with examples: `references/signals.md`.

**Do NOT log:** one-off corrections that don't generalise; preferences
already captured in a skill; tool bugs unrelated to methodology;
observations that would need proprietary client information to be useful
in an open-source skill (unless an internal skill is the right home). The
generalisability test, when unsure: would this still make sense in another
project, and for another task using the same skill? Does it name a missing
rule, step or principle rather than fix this task? Is it likely to recur?
Mostly no → task context, not an observation. Before minting a
`proposes_skill` name, check the existing candidates and reuse a fitting
one — independently logged proposals for one skill rarely share a name.

**Validate the target at write time.** A name in `skill:` must be a skill
that exists now; if it doesn't, the observation proposes a skill instead.
Checking is cheap at write time and expensive forty entries later.

**Check the target's siblings at write time, and record that you did.**
Libraries accumulate *families* — several skills implementing one
methodology for different tools, one structure for different subjects, one
companion pattern for different base skills. An insight found while using
one member usually applies to the rest, but nothing in the workflow asks,
so `skill:` collapses to a single entry and the family silently diverges.
Before writing, resolve the target against the family registry
(`skill-observations/skill-families.md`; spec, coherence models and the
no-registry fallback in `references/observation-log.md`), and for each
sibling either add it to `skill:` or state in the body why it does not
apply. Fast test: **could this sentence survive having the tool's or
subject's name removed?** If yes it belongs to every sibling — and a rule
that declares itself generic inside one artefact ("this applies to any
file-writing script, not just X") is the cheapest possible propagation
signal, so treat that phrasing as an automatic multi-skill flag. Then
record the outcome in the mandatory `siblings_checked:` frontmatter field,
including the verdict "checked — instance-specific, no propagation": a
one-entry `skill:` list is byte-identical whether the siblings were
evaluated or never considered, and only the recorded field makes the
*absence* of the judgement visible to a review or a drift audit.

## How to Log

Write the observation file **silently, within the same turn or the next** —
never batch mentally for later; the act of writing is the enforcement
mechanism.

**Mandatory checkpoint after every 3rd completed todo item.** After marking
the 3rd, 6th, 9th (etc.) item complete, you must **write to disk** — not
merely ask yourself whether anything is pending. Either write any pending
observation files, or, if genuinely none have accumulated, append a
one-line `no observations` acknowledgement to
`skill-observations/checkpoints.log`. The required action is a concrete
write; a remembered "ask whether" is not enforcement. The count need not be
precise; roughly every third completion is the rule. (Exception: where the
workspace is a shared hosted document store in which every write is priced
and invalidates other sessions' context, suppress the empty marker and
keep only the check — see `references/environments.md`.)

**A denied or failed write is not a read-only log.** Retry once before
concluding the workspace is unwritable, and try a second tool that reaches
the same path — a permission classifier can deny one interface while
allowing another, and consecutive denials from a probabilistic gatekeeper
are noise, not a wall. Report "failed N times", never "cannot be done",
unless retries and alternate interfaces are actually exhausted; otherwise
observations are silently lost for the rest of the session.

**Deliverable-event flush.** Whenever you present or render a major
deliverable — a file handed to the user, a deck or PDF render, a staged
skill file — or complete a task/todo batch, write any pending observation
files at that moment, before moving on. These checkpoints already involve a
tool call; piggy-backing the flush onto them makes the write a side effect
of work you were doing anyway. (Why both checkpoints are writes rather than
questions: `references/observation-log.md`.)

**Two gaps this pairing still leaves — both observed across full working days
in which nothing was logged at all.**

1. *A session can contain no todo items whatsoever.* The 3rd-completion
   checkpoint is bound to ONE tool; work driven entirely through direct tool
   calls and shell commands never trips it. It is armed only in sessions that
   happen to use todos, so it is not a safety net that is always present. When
   a session runs without them, the deliverable flush is the only enforcement
   left and must be applied deliberately.
2. *"Is this a major deliverable?" is a self-assessment, and self-assessment is
   what fails under load.* Prefer triggers unmistakable in the tool record over
   ones needing a judgement call. In particular, treat any **project-completing
   command** — a deploy, release, publish, or push — as a flush point: it is a
   concrete tool call, as hard a trigger as a completed todo, and it reliably
   marks the end of a unit of work where insights have accumulated.

The rule behind both: an enforcement trigger must hang on an event objectively
visible in the tool record, never on the agent noticing that a moment qualifies.
And a counter bound to a single tool is silently inert in every session that does
not use it — such triggers always need a second, independent path.

**Id and filename.** Each observation is `NNNN-short-slug.md` (zero-padded
id + a kebab-case slug from the title). The id is the highest of three
values, plus one: the highest numeric prefix in `observation-log/`, the
highest in `observation-log/archive/`, and the number in
`observation-log/archive/.id-floor` (the highest id ever issued — update it
whenever you issue an id above it, so the counter can never restart from 1
when the active directory is empty):

```bash
d=skill-observations/observation-log
hi=$( { ls "$d" "$d/archive" 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '^[0-9]+'; cat "$d/archive/.id-floor" 2>/dev/null; } \
     | sort -n | tail -1); : "${hi:=0}"
[ "$hi" -eq 0 ] && [ -n "$(ls "$d"/*.md 2>/dev/null)" ] && { echo "ID COMMAND BROKEN — log is non-empty but no ids extracted"; exit 1; }
next_id=$(( hi + 1 )); echo "$next_id" > "$d/archive/.id-floor"
```

The guard line distinguishes "the log says zero" from "I could not read
the log": a command that fails to empty rather than to error would
otherwise propose id 1 in a populated log. A new file never touches another entry's bytes, so it cannot truncate,
overwrite or renumber anyone else's work. If two parallel sessions pick the
same id, two files share a number — harmless; the next review renumbers one
and logs a meta-observation.

**Batch writes: resolve each id at its own write time.** When logging more
than one observation in a session that may overlap a scheduled review or
another writer, run the id snippet before EACH file — never pre-compute a
range and hardcode sequential numbers into a batch. A batch append is N
separate races, not one; pre-baked numbers collapse N independent
max-checks into a single stale read (observed: a hardcoded id collided
with one a parallel review issued between the check and the write).

**A structural probe that comes back empty where content existed before is
a stop signal, not a create.** If the directory or file you logged to
earlier in the session is suddenly missing, or the id check returns empty
in a log you know is populated, HALT and re-probe the structure (is there
an `observation-log/`? a `log.md.migrated`?) — a parallel session may have
migrated or reorganised the storage. Never let an append silently recreate
a missing target: that converts a migration signal into corruption
(observed: a stale session recreated the retired `log.md` with a fresh
"Observation 1" after the per-file migration renamed it).

**File format.** YAML frontmatter (the metadata every scan reads) followed
by the Issue → Improvement → Principle body. **The frontmatter is mandatory;
always write `status: open` and a non-empty `siblings_checked:` at creation
time** — an observation without a `status` field is treated as OPEN by
reviews, never as nonexistent, and one without `siblings_checked:` counts
as logged without a sibling check.

---

**Issue:** [What happened — specific enough to understand weeks later
without the original conversation.]

**Suggested improvement:** [Concrete change. For existing skills, name the
section or rule; for new skills, scope and key components.]

**Principle:** [The generalisable takeaway — the most important field.]
```

**`parked` means decided, not pending.** Use it when an observation is sound
but cannot be acted on until an external precondition is met — the scheduled
task that produced it is disabled, the tool it describes is out of use, a
dependency has not landed. A parked entry is OUT of the work queue: reviews
must not re-escalate it, and the decision belongs in `status:`, not in a
free-text note beside a `status: open` (a note nothing classifies on leaves
the entry in the queue and it gets re-raised at every review). It is not
resolved either, so it never archives — archival needs a resolved status plus
a `resolved:` date. It stays in `observation-log/` indefinitely until either
its `parked_until:` condition is met — set it back to `open` and queue it — or
it is genuinely resolved. `parked_until:` is mandatory whenever status is
`parked`: one line stating the condition, phrased so a later session can
actually answer whether it has happened.

**Context preservation:** if an observation depends on session-local data
(uploads, API output), save that context into the workspace first and set
`reference:` to its path — an observation whose evidence dies with the
session is incomplete.

**Confidentiality at logging time:** for `type: open-source` observations,
the Issue/Improvement fields may reference specifics for context, but the
Principle must be fully generalised — no client names, domains, or details
traceable to a real project. Full confidentiality layers:
`references/skill-authoring.md`.

**Changing an existing observation:** re-read that one file, edit only the
frontmatter fields you are changing (`status`, `parked_until`, `resolved`,
`resolution`),
never batch-rewrite the directory. Archival is a plain `mv` (below).

## Referencing Observations

Cite an observation by the `id` field in its frontmatter (= the `NNNN-`
filename prefix). Never cite a `grep -n` line number as if it were the id —
search-tool line numbers are positional metadata, not identifiers. A cited
id must fall within the range that exists across `observation-log/`,
`archive/` and `.id-floor`; a number far outside it is almost certainly a
line number misread as an id.

## Taxonomy (quick version)

**Open-source** — client-agnostic, methodology-driven, useful to other
practitioners. **Internal** — contains user/client/project specifics or
personal preferences. Default to open-source when it could go either way,
stripping specifics. The boundary is also a confidentiality boundary, and
the two errors are not symmetric: over-classifying as internal costs only
reach, under-classifying can leak — when genuinely uncertain, prefer
internal and promote later. Full requirements (attribution, licensing,
structure): `references/skill-authoring.md`.

## Archival on Write

On every write, first `mv` already-resolved files from `observation-log/`
to `observation-log/archive/`. "Already resolved" is read from the file's
own frontmatter: `status: actioned`, `declined` or `superseded` AND a
`resolved:` date **before today**. Files resolved today stay until the next
day, whichever session resolved them — the grace period lives in the file,
never in session memory. A resolved file with no readable `resolved:` date
gets today's date written to that field instead of being archived. One
file per `mv`; no rewrite of anything else. Helper and rationale:
`references/observation-log.md`.

## Surfacing Protocol

Default: at end of session, as a grouped summary — improvements grouped by
skill, new-skill candidates listed separately; for each, one sentence plus
suggested type; ask which to act on. Surface earlier when an observation
needs user input to be complete, when a skill is actively producing wrong
output, or when observations cluster on one skill.

**Deferral wears a second disguise: not a promise, but an argument.** "Let's
wait until this has seen a few days of real use", "we should gather more data
first" — this reads as diligence, which is exactly why it goes unchallenged,
including by the person saying it. It is not an announcement, so a rule about
executing rather than announcing does not catch it. So before writing *any*
"later" into a recommendation, name two things: **which specific observation
would change the decision, and when it could realistically arrive.** If you
cannot name one, the evidence is either already conclusive (act now) or waiting
adds nothing (act now). Then ask what the delay costs — if a known-defective
state stays live meanwhile, the burden of proof is on deferring, not on acting.
A deferral is a decision and needs the same justification as acting; "more
evidence would be better" is not one, because the question is whether more
evidence could change the OUTCOME.

**Default to log-and-defer.** Surfacing an observation is not an invitation
to act on it: state that it is logged for the next review, and stop.
Reserve in-session application strictly for the triggers under "Acting on
Observations". Do NOT routinely offer a binary "apply now vs leave for next
review" choice; for users who run regular reviews that offer is unwanted
friction, and if a user has said they always defer, suppress it entirely.

**Self-check before surfacing:** observations were logged throughout the
whole session (including discussion phases); logged silently; each follows
Issue → Improvement → Principle; each is typed; existing-skill items name
the section; no open-source Principle contains client-identifying info;
every observation file carries `status:` (`status: open` at write time) and
a non-empty `siblings_checked:` — if any lacks one, do the sibling check
now and record it rather than back-filling the field with `none`.

## Acting on Observations

Act only in three contexts: (1) the comprehensive review (load
`references/weekly-review.md`); (2) an explicit user request ("update X
skill", "act on observation #N"); (3) in-session correction when a skill is
producing wrong output the user should know about. Otherwise: log, don't
act.

**Read the full body before resolving, dismissing, fixing, or citing.** A
tracked item's title (observation, GitHub issue, ticket) is an index entry,
not its content — it compresses away the failure story, the reporter's
context, and often the proposed fix. Dismissal is the path with no
downstream checkpoint: a resolved or cited item gets reviewed later, a
dismissed one silently disappears. Harvest fix designs from issue bodies —
reporters frequently include the correct solution, which also settles
attribution. When a parallel agent logs a finding that appears to duplicate
your own, diff the two bodies, not the titles: two entries about the same
mechanism can carry opposite operational conclusions, and the second is
often the refinement, not the echo. Apparent agreement suppresses
verification more effectively than disagreement does, so this rule binds
hardest exactly where it feels least necessary.

When acting: small, clearly-additive, low-risk changes (a new rule, a
clarification, a factual fix) may be applied without waiting for the next
review — "directly" means *now*, not *in place*: the edit is still made on
a staged copy based on a fresh read of the live file and handed to the user
to install, in every environment and every context. Staging-only has no
interactive exception; an exception the user has to remember is a gate
that eventually gets left open. Substantial changes (restructuring, new
capabilities, changed methodology) and all new-skill creation: load
`references/skill-authoring.md` first and follow its editing and staging
rules. A principle that applies to skills generally goes to the
cross-cutting principles file (same reference).

**Set the status in the same turn you act.** An observation acted on
in-session must have its frontmatter updated — `status: actioned`,
`resolved: YYYY-MM-DD`, `resolution: what was done` — before the turn
ends. The work and the bookkeeping are two acts, and the second is the one
that gets dropped; a stale `open` entry then invites redoing finished work
over a section that has since moved on. The write is the enforcement,
exactly as it is for logging.

## Quick Reference

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| When do I observe? | The whole session, including feedback and reflection phases |
| How do I log? | Silently, immediately, as one file per observation named `NNNN-slug.md`; id = max(active, archive, `.id-floor`) + 1 |
| When do I surface? | End of session, or earlier if needed |
| Status field? | Mandatory `status: open` frontmatter on every new observation; reviews treat a missing status as OPEN, never as nonexistent. Five values: `open`, `actioned`, `declined`, `superseded`, `parked` — `parked` = decided but blocked on an external precondition, so it leaves the queue, requires `parked_until:`, and never archives |
| Does the target skill have siblings? | Resolve it against `skill-observations/skill-families.md` BEFORE writing; add every sibling the insight applies to to `skill:`, and record the verdict in the mandatory `siblings_checked:` field — including "checked, no propagation" |
| A scan or query came back empty? | Two possibilities, only one is a finding: guard every retrieval meant to prevent duplicate work with an independent existence check, and treat empty output over known content as a broken command |
| Citing an observation number? | From the `id:` frontmatter field (= the `NNNN-` filename prefix); never a `grep -n` line number; sanity-check against the known id range |
| Open-source or internal? | Default open-source; the boundary is confidential |
| Small fix or substantial? | Additive → apply directly; restructuring/new skill → `references/skill-authoring.md` |
| Changing an observation (status/archival)? | Re-read that one file, edit only its frontmatter, or `mv` it to `observation-log/archive/` — no shared-file rewrite |
| Upgrading from a single-file `log.md`? | Scripted, once — `references/migration.md` |
| Weekly review? | Trigger check at session start; procedure in `references/weekly-review.md` |
| No filesystem? | Handoff-doc mode — `references/environments.md` |
